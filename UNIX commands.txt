(>) standard output redirectional operator => eg: cat > gowthamfile1 => to write something in the file (CTRL + D to save the file after entering content) 

(<) standard input redirectional operator => eg: cat < gowthamfile1 => to display the file content. 

(>>) standard append redirectional operator => eg: cat >> gowthamfile1 => to add some additional content to already existing file (CTRL + D to save the file after entering content) 

cat file1 file2 > file3 => creates a new files called file3 and copies the contents of file1 and file2 into it.
