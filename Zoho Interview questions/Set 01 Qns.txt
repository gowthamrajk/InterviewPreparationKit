SET 1

Second Round: (Normal Programming round)
1. Print the word with odd letters as

P         M
 R      A
   O  R
     G
  O    R
 R       A
P          M 


2. Given a set of numbers like <10, 36, 54,89,12> we want to find sum of weights based on the following conditions
    1. 5 if a perfect square
    2. 4 if multiple of 4 and divisible by 6
    3. 3 if even number

And sort the numbers based on the weight and print it as follows

<10,its_weight>,<36,its weight><89,its weight>

Should display the numbers based on increasing order.


3. Save the string “WELCOMETOZOHOCORPORATION” in a two dimensional array and search for substring like “too” in the two dimensional string both from left to right and from top to bottom.

w	e	L	C	O
M	E	T	O	Z
O	H	O	C	O
R	P	O	R	A
T	I	O	n	  

And print the start and ending index as

Start index : <1,2>

End index: <3, 2>


4. Given a 9×9 sudoku we have to evaluate it for its correctness. We have to check both the sub matrix correctness and the whole sudoku correctness.


5. Given a two dimensional array of string like

  <”luke”, “shaw”>
  <”wayne”, “rooney”>
  <”rooney”, “ronaldo”>
  <”shaw”, “rooney”> 

Where the first string is “child”, second string is “Father”. And given “ronaldo” we have to find his no of grandchildren Here “ronaldo” has 2 grandchildren. So our output should be 2.


Third Round: (Advanced Programming Round)


Here they asked us to create a “Railway reservation system” and gave us 4 modules. The modules were:
    1. Booking
    2. Availability checking
    3. Cancellation
    4. Prepare chart
We were asked to create the modules for representing each data first and to continue with the implementation phase.
